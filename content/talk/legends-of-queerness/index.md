summary: "Salon: Who Gets to be a Fan? Identity Politics in Superhero Fandom" 
abstract: "In the popular CW superhero series Arrow, vigilante Sara Lance is revealed to be a queer character when she is shown kissing Nyssa al Ghul, her assassin ex-girlfriend. Later in the same episode, Sara is shown kissing Oliver Queen, the show’s male protagonist. Throughout her character development in both Arrow and in her later, central role in DC’s Legends of Tomorrow, Sara has been portrayed as being a sexually fluid character, with a variety of love interests both male and female. During a crossover episode with The Flash, the character acknowledges her sexuality directly, stating that “… I like men, and I like women.” As a representation of bisexuality in modern media and as a central character in a popular superhero television series, Sara Lance has a significant role in larger conversation about queer representation in fan spaces. Overall, this research closely investigates the fan activity surrounding Sara’s character in the “Arrowverse” and how Sara, as a representation of bisexuality, has impacted superhero fandom. 
This was investigated through an analysis of fan activity on the social media website Tumblr relating to the character and her sexuality, utilizing data collected from selected Tumblr posts to investigate the fan community surrounding Sara Lance. Through this investigation, it was found that fans have a generally positive reaction to Sara’s character and to her as a representation of bisexuality, that fans seem to appreciate the depictions of bi and pan sexuality in Legends of Tomorrow and enjoy seeing multiple queer characters depicted in the same show, and that fans show appreciation of both Sara’s platonic and romantic relationships with other “Arrowverse characters. Overall, posts reflected that Sara is important as a representation of bisexuality for fans and that this type of representation is important to that fan community."
