  While researchers of sexuality in media have argued that representation of LGBT characters in media may not have always have a significant impact on society or queer-identifying media consumers (Meyer & Wood, 2013; Johnson, 2016), fan communities frequently create spaces for themselves surrounding both canonical and non-canonically queer characters. In a study conducted by Lothian et al, one participant described a queer space as one “…in which things happen that challenge they way gendered and sexual identities and practices are defined…” (2007, p. 109).  Online communities have the potential to become a space for fans to discuss and critique media for its efforts, or lack there of, to be inclusive of queer identities.  

  This paper is an investigation into queer representation in the DC Television Shows Arrow, DC’s Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl and The Flash. These shows in particular represent a unique space for inquiry because they seem to be catering themselves to a different audience than the comic books on which they are based did. The comic book genre has been traditionally associated with a white-male audience. While these shows, which have placed female and queer-identifying characters at the forefront of storylines, seem to be making an effort to make their shows relatable for a wider range of people, they take a normative, socially accepted path in doing so.  These shows explore female subcultures and sexuality in a way that, as Maria San Filippo explains, negotiates the “unfamiliar terrain…by way of a familiar route (a primarily heterosexual male subculture)” (2013, p. 6). Studying the fannish activity of these shows, specifically surrounding queer representations, will help to illuminate if these shows are succeeding in bringing in fans that wouldn’t traditionally be thought of as included in the comic-book subculture.  

  The investigation of one particular ongoing fandom and a specific subset of interest, queer fans and pairings, provides the opportunity to investigate fan interaction in a specific space and within a specific community. Using a collection of three weeks of fan activity on Tumblr, focusing in on the hashtags of each of the four shows, #supergirl, #legendsoftomorrow, #flash, and #arrow, this study uses qualitative and quantitative analysis of fan-generated data to answer the following questions: Which queer characters and pairings appear to be discussed most, how they are being discussed?  Do queer fans seem to relate to or identify with these characters? Are fans are commenting on the way these shows present LGBT characters, and if so what is their reaction?  What are fans’ reactions to non-canonically queer pairings, and how does that differ from their reactions to canonically queer pairings?  This study will go beyond discussion of the shows’ content and focus the world that fans are creating when they discuss these shows online.  Due to the diversity of fan activities on Tumblr, this study investigates the more brief, in-the-moment texts fans produce as they watch and respond to the shows, such as hashtags (as commentary), text posts and comments, still images, and gifs.
