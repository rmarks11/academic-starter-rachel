summary: "Panel: Gender, Genre, & the Social" 
abstract: "Sara Lance, a key character in the shows Arrow and DC’s Legends of Tomorrow is one of the first queer characters to be portrayed as queer in the superhero television genre. This study explores the representation of Sara Lance’s sexuality over time through close observation of key episodes in which her sexuality is enacted or discussed. It becomes apparent as her sexuality is explored in more detail that while Sara’s character does work on some level to dismantle traditional conceptions of sexuality, the stereotypes applied to her character and the contextdependent ways in which her sexuality is developed harm the overall effectiveness of her representation as a bisexual character. This essay explores these stereotypes and the evolution of Sara’s sexuality to reach the conclusion that Sara’s character, despite the apparent attempts of the shows to not label her sexuality, is still constrained in her expressions of sexuality by the context in which she is placed."
