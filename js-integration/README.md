# Javascript Integration

Here, I outline how Javascript is being used on my personal website: [rachelmarks.netfliy.app](rachelmarks.netflify.app)

## Animated Scrolling

In the first video, [JS Scroll Capture](JS_scroll_capture.mov), I demonstrate how Javascript is being used to automatically scoll down my site when clicking different tabs in the top menu. My code is calling out to an outside Javascript library called JQuery, in order to animate the scroll top characteristic of my site. 

## Changing Themes

In the second video, [JS Theme Capture](JS_theme_capture.mov), I show how Javascript is being used to change the theme of my website between dark and light styles. The code is switching which CSS (cascading style sheet) class of attributes is attached to the site's body.
